# Chatroom

This started out as a project for my Object Oriented Design class. The idea was to pick a topic we had not learned about and use it in some way (and no online tutorials/code walkthroughs!). At the time, I had done absolutely nothing with networks or multithreaded programs, and decided a chatroom was a good way of learning about both.

In the original spirit of the project, I want to learn about Java Swing and implementing programs with multiple languages. So now my goal is to add a GUI and implement some basic cryptographic security features using a C library I used in my Software Security class called sodium.

# TODO

##Features
-Add working GUI
-More commands!
-Passwords generated with cryptographic principles in mind
-More security features (ie attempting to avoid malicious connections and messages).
