# Blackjack AI

This is my final project for the current semester, in which I am taking a course in Artificial Intelligence. So hopefully it will be done by mid-December!

I am recreating the casino game, Blackjack, in which a player attempts to gain a hand that is equal to 21 in value (but no more than that). They have a variety of options at any point in time, from buying insurance, splitting, doubling down, etc. It's a classic game for AI study, and I thought it would make a good basis for my project. I recommend watching [this video by Triple S Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjqTIzYkGdI&ab_channel=TripleSGames), as it is what I have been using for my model.

The project is very vague and broad, in that I can choose anything that may fit within the scope of the course and is able to be completed by the end of the semester. I have chosen to compare and contrast the decision making and the success of Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Expectimax algorithms. 

An inspiration for the design of the project (such as having a game state class, generate_successor() function, etc) was [UC Berkeley's PacMan Projects](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp22/projects/). I have worked my way through most of them at this point in time, and found the organization and design really helpful. I recommend them to anyone who is studying AI. :)
