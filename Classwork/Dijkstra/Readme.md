# Algorithms I - Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation

## What is this?

I was to create a program that read data from a file, "city.dat", where every line represented a city and an undirected edge between another city, along with the weight (distance) of the connection between them. Then, it would prompt the user for input and search for the shortest path using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

While the dynamic array implementation was provided by my professor, ___, the rest of the code is my own (including the makefile, I suppose).

## Why include this?

It was one of my earliest C programs in one of my earliest classes. I know Dijkstra's algorithm is probably done to death - but heck, this was hard at the time! 

There was no better way to learn how this algorithm worked than by implementing it in C. I'm really glad my professor made us do this.
