# Databases - Load XML to SQL Database and Analyze with Datawarehouse

## What is this?

This is my second big project in my databases class. Create 3 R scripts: the first should load data from an XML document into a normalized SQL database (that I had to design). Next, the data had to be processed and stored into a separate datawarehouse for analysis. Lastly, a third script just to display some information to the user, to demonstrate that the warehouse can be used for such analysis.

## Why include this?

This project really felt like a culmination of knowledge of my databases class. Design a database, load data from an XML file (which may or may not be formatted properly), put it into the database, group the data for analysis and save it to a datawarehouse - it was everything! And my code doesn't run too slowly for the size of the data (my computer runs it in about 11 minutes).
