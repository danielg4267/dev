# Databases - Load data from a CSV file to a SQL Database

## What is this?

This is my first big project in my databases class. The goal was to create an R Markdown file that would walk someone through the steps of loading data from a CSV file into a normalized SQL database.

## Why include this?

While it was relatively simple in concept, but it took a while, especially since it was assigned in the first half of the semester, when SQL was still relatively new to me! It was a big project, and I felt like I organized it well.
