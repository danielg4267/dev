# Algorithms - Skiplist Implementation

## What is this?

I was asked to implement a skiplist. Didn't matter the language. I chose Java. The object oriented nature of it made it much easier to design and implement a skiplist.

## Why include this?

It was a quick and dirty implementation of a really fun and interesting data structure. Why NOT include it? :D
