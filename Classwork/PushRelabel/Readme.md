# Algorithms - Push Relabel

## What is this?

In my algorithms class, we were required to actually implement a few algorithms.

One of our homework assignments was to implement the Push Relabel algorithm, which finds the maximum network flow given a graph. I used Java to implement it. 

We were not required to implement the graph itself, only the algorithm, thus I found a weighted graph implementation and adapted it to represent a network. The original work can be found here:

Obviously anything relating to networks, and of course the actual algorithm, was my own implementation.

## Why include this?

Algorithms are hard! I was just proud of being able to understand and implement something like this.
