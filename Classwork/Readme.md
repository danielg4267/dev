# Classwork

Hello there! You've stumbled onto some classwork assignments I've completed. These are generally not longer projects - assignments that I was given anywhere from a day to a week to complete. So while not necessarily the most impressive (or well-documented) code, I was just proud of the work I put into completing the assignment. They all involved learning something new, and implementing concepts learned in class always comes with its own challenges.

I thought it worthwhile to include a few of them, for whoever might wish to see them.
