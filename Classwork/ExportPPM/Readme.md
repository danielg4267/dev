# Computer Graphics - The First Assignment

## What is this?

The assignment details are included in a separate markdown file. The assignment was essentially to use some prebuilt data structures for pixel data
and learn about some of the more fine-grained details of displaying images, particularly triangles, given a screen with coordinates. It is the most basic you can get with computer graphics.

Everything in "main.cpp" under DrawLine() and the exported .ppm file is my own. Otherwise, it was included by my professor, Mike Shah.

## Why Include This?

I had always been interested in computer graphics, even in high school. Not because I wanted to become a graphics engineer (though, that sounds very cool!), but rather because it's such an interesting concept. How does a computer understand how to display images, colors, and the like? What's going on behind the scenes?

When I made it into a computer science program, I knew one of my first electives had to be a computer graphics course. I was so excited to learn about it.

This assignment isn't anything crazy - calculate which pixels to color in a .ppm file to create some triangles. It was more about the concept than anything else. But when I got those triangles on the screen, boy was I excited and proud. I showed them off to everyone. 

And now, dear reader, I get to show them to you!
